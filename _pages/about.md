Hi, my name is Renato. I like cosmology, because therein lies the greatest of mysteries, the evolution of the universe, contains all the drama, suspense, and cool narrative elements while being classical and continuous. In this project, I explore the unofficial SpaceX API with Data Science and provide a framework where you can also explore the data with your own analysis. The API can be found [Here]([https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)). This is an open Source REST API for launch, rocket, core, capsule, starlink, launchpad, and landing pad data.

I wll analyz the information from the SpaceX API using Python & Anaconda and create a tidy dataset for additional research. I will automate the procedure and the necessary data filtering using Python functions, and will provided a framework for any visitors who want to investigate the data and conduct their own research. For my project, I'll utilize the SpaceX data to evaluate whether a launch will be successful or not and whether a landing will be successful or not by using GraphQL and ML
