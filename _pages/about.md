Hi, my name is Renato. I like cosmology, because therein lies the greatest of mysteries, the evolution of the universe, contains all the drama, suspense, and cool narrative elements while being classical and continuous. In this project, I explore the unofficial SpaceX API with Data Science and provide a framework where you can also explore the data with your own analysis. The API can be found [Here]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)). This is an open Source REST API for launch, rocket, core, capsule, starlink, launchpad, and landing pad data.

I analyzed the information from the SpaceX API using Python & Anaconda and created a tidy dataset for additional research. I've automated the procedure and the necessary data filtering using Python functions, and I've provided a framework for any visitors who want to investigate the data and conduct their own research. For my project, I'll utilize the SpaceX data to evaluate whether a launch will be successful or not and whether a landing will be successful or not.

Check out the video below - SpaceX Falcon Heavy Liftoff & Landing - Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, United States - 02-06-2018, this is what I will be trying to predict when analyzing the SpaceX API with Data Science.
