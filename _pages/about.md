Hi, my name is Renato. I like cosmology, because therein lies the greatest of mysteries, the evolution of the universe, contains all the drama, suspense, and cool narrative elements while being classical and continuous. In this project, I explore the unofficial SpaceX API with Data Science and provide a framework where you can also explore the data with your own analysis. The API can be found [Here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API). This is an open Source REST API for launch, rocket, core, capsule, starlink, launchpad, and landing pad data.
