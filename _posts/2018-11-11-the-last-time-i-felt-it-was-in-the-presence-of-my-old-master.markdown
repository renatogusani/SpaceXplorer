I used the KDD process primarily to extract information from SpaceX API data in the context of large databases. I accomplished this by employing Data Mining algorithms to identify what is considered knowledge. Knowledge Discovery in Databases is defined as the systematic, exploratory analysis and modeling of large data repositories. 

### What is KDD?
KDD, or knowledge discovery in databases, is a technique for extracting useful information and patterns from a raw database so that they can be applied to various fields or applications. 

The aforementioned sentence provides an overview or idea of KDD, however the process is extensive and complex and requires numerous steps and iterations. I will try to set the tone with an example before I go into the specifics of KDD.

Imagine that there is a little river nearby and that you are either a stone collector, a craft hobbyist, or a chance explorer. You already know that a riverbed is littered with stones, shells, and other unrelated things. Without this fundamental assumption, one cannot get to the source.

Then, depending on who you are, your needs and requirements may differ. This is the second most important concept to grasp. So you go ahead and gather any stones, shells, coins, or other artifacts that may be lying on the riverbed. However, this brings dirt and other unwanted objects with it, which you will need to remove before the objects can be used again. 

At this point, you may need to return and collect additional items based on your requirements, and this process may need to be repeated several times or completely skipped depending on the circumstances.

To better suit your application, the collected objects must be separated into different types and cut, polished, or painted. This is known as the transformation stage. 

During this process, you learn where you are more likely to find larger stones of a particular color - whether near the bank or deeper in the river, whether the artifacts are more likely to be found upstream or downstream, and so on. When learning data science, data mining is an important component.

This aids in the decoding of patterns, which can lead to more efficient and faster task completion. You will eventually discover knowledge that is refined, reliable, and highly specific to your application.

### Steps Involved in a Typical KDD Process

### 1. Setting Goals and Understanding Application 

This is the first step in the process, and it necessitates prior understanding and knowledge of the field in question. This is where we decide how to use the transformed data and patterns discovered by data mining to extract knowledge. This is a critical premise that, if incorrectly set, can lead to incorrect interpretations and negative consequences for the end-user.

### 2. Data Gathering and Integration 

Following the establishment of goals and objectives, the collected data must be selected and classified into meaningful sets based on availability, accessibility importance, and quality. These parameters are critical for data mining because they form the foundation and influence the types of data models that are formed. 

### 3. Data Preparation and Cleaning 

This step entails looking for missing data and removing noisy, redundant, and low-quality data from the data set in order to increase the data's reliability and effectiveness. Certain algorithms are used to search for and eliminate unwanted data based on application-specific attributes.

### 4. Data Conversion 

This step prepares the data for processing by data mining algorithms. As a result, the data must be consolidated and aggregated. The data is consolidated based on functions, attributes, features, and so on. 

### 5. Information Mining 

This is the foundation or backbone process of the entire KDD. Algorithms are used here to extract meaningful patterns from transformed data, which aids prediction models. It is an analytical tool that aids in the discovery of trends in a data set by employing techniques such as artificial intelligence, advanced numerical and statistical methods, and specialized algorithms.

### 6. Pattern Analysis and Interpretation 

After obtaining the trend and patterns from various data mining methods and iterations, these patterns must be represented in discrete forms such as bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and so on in order to study the impact of data collected and transformed in previous steps. This also aids in determining the effectiveness of a specific data model in relation to the domain. 

### 7. Knowledge Acquisition and Application 

This is the final step in the KDD process, and it requires the 'knowledge' extracted in the previous step to be applied to the specific application or domain in a visual format, such as tables, reports, and so on. This step directs the application's decision-making process.

### Conclusion 

In today's world, data is generated from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, such as economic transactions, biometrics, scientific data, images and videos, and so on. With such massive amounts of information being traded every second, a technique that can extract the juice and provide reliable, high-quality, and effective data for use in various fields for decision making is critical. This is where KDD comes in handy.
