I used the KDD process primarily to extract information from SpaceX API data in the context of large databases. I accomplished this by employing Data Mining algorithms to identify what is considered knowledge. Knowledge Discovery in Databases is defined as the systematic, exploratory analysis and modeling of large data repositories. 

### What is KDD?
KDD, or knowledge discovery in databases, is a technique for extracting useful information and patterns from a raw database so that they can be applied to various fields or applications. 

The aforementioned sentence provides an overview or idea of KDD, however the process is extensive and complex and requires numerous steps and iterations. I will try to set the tone with an example before I go into the specifics of KDD.

Imagine that there is a little river nearby and that you are either a stone collector, a craft hobbyist, or a chance explorer. You already know that a riverbed is littered with stones, shells, and other unrelated things. Without this fundamental assumption, one cannot get to the source.

Then, depending on who you are, your needs and requirements may differ. This is the second most important concept to grasp. So you go ahead and gather any stones, shells, coins, or other artifacts that may be lying on the riverbed. However, this brings dirt and other unwanted objects with it, which you will need to remove before the objects can be used again. 

At this point, you may need to return and collect additional items based on your requirements, and this process may need to be repeated several times or completely skipped depending on the circumstances.

To better suit your application, the collected objects must be separated into different types and cut, polished, or painted. This is known as the transformation stage. 

During this process, you learn where you are more likely to find larger stones of a particular color - whether near the bank or deeper in the river, whether the artifacts are more likely to be found upstream or downstream, and so on. When learning data science, data mining is an important component.

This aids in the decoding of patterns, which can lead to more efficient and faster task completion. You will eventually discover knowledge that is refined, reliable, and highly specific to your application.

*KDD Methdology Process*

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. I'm trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

1. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
2. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
3. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

Don’t be too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them. What?! I don’t know what you’re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic.
